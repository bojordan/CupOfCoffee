CupOfCoffee
===========

A small utility to keep the Windows machine screen saver or screen lock from activating. I find this helpful when group policies are aggressive, or when in an RDP session.

I don't often use this utility, as [Windows PowerToys Awake](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/awake) has replaced it for most of my needs. However, there are cases where I can't install PowerToys, and a single file executable is helpful.
